# VoucherBot
Hey I provide the sources of a bot Voucher for your orders
The bot is fully customizable

It's not a bot that can support several servers, but only one where your project is located.<br>
⚠️ I'll probably make updates in the coming days comme⚠️

## 🚧 Requirements

  - [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## 📜 How to use it

  - Extract the .zip file
  - Open it with your text editor
  - Open a terminal and type: npm i (It will install all modules at once)
  - Finally, replace the information with that of your server 
  - Don't forget to change the IDs.
